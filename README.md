# InsightFlow 🧠  
**AI-Powered Knowledge Sync for Remote Teams**

InsightFlow helps remote teams stay aligned by capturing key knowledge and building a shared, searchable memory — without interrupting your workflow.

## 🚀 What is InsightFlow?

Remote work is amazing — until your team forgets what was said, when, and where.

InsightFlow:
- **Organizes internal knowledge** automatically
- **Surfaces what matters** from conversations
- Becomes your team's second brain

We're currently building v0.1 in public.

## 🧩 Features (Planned MVP)
- Smart conversation parsing
- Memory engine for topic tracking
- Searchable, taggable team summaries
- Private team workspace (Notion-like UX)
- Role-based views (devs, PMs, leads)
